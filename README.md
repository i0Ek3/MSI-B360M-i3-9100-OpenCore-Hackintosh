# OpenCore-MSI-B360M-i3-9100-UHD630
Hackintosh for MSI B360M with OpenCore.

## Before That

The [original EFI](https://github.com/SuperNG6/MSI-B360-Big-Sur-EFI/releases/download/12.1/ONLY.IGPU.Macmini8.1.zip)  version was created by [SuperNG6](https://github.com/SuperNG6), and I made some changes based on it, adding themes(themes I used [5T33Z0](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Lenovo-T530-Hackintosh-OpenCore)'s version, thanks to him) and fine-tuned Quirks according to my personal preferences.

Cause of my SSD or something else, I cannot upgrade to Monterey, but that not means this version cannot use to Monterey, I just cannot test it.

Another thing you need to know is that I'm still in the learning phase of OC so it will take a while to get completely out of the reference, but I'll try to get it done.

Also I have a lot of other devices, I can't ask others to update as soon as possible, so I need to master the configuration method by myself to provide the EFI of my other devices, and share with you guys here.
